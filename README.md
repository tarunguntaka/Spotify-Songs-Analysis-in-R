# Spotify-Songs-Analysis-in-R
The problem that I am trying to address with this project is to try to find and analyse the features which directly contribute to the popularity of a song. There are many different kinds of songs which are releasing every day. What makes a song more likeable than another? Why is one genre more popular than another? These are some of the questions I plan on addressing through this project.


# The Following Tasks are performed

- Correlation between the different variables

- Identifying each genreâ€™s features and how Spotify classifies genres

- Analyzing features that affect popularity

- A predictive model to identify popularity of a song

- By performing Data Preparation, Exploratory Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling.

Based on our analysis, the consumer will be able to identify which factors influence the popularity of a song on Spotify.
